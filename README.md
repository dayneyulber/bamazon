# bamazon

###### The bamazon app begins by asking the user to shop through the terminal.

###### This is followed by asking the user what item and how many units they would like to purchase. 
![howmany](https://github.com/dayneyulber/bamazon/blob/master/images/howmany.png)

###### If there are sufficient units, the result is the total cost, while the database is updated to reflect the remaining number of units.

###### If not, we inform the user. In both cases, the app restarts with the updated database.
